# MapReduce
MapReduce Jobs created with Java to analyse information from a dataset with worldwide commercial transactions.

The repository contains many folders, each folder has 3 files used to retrieve the information:

    1. java file -> contains the MapReduce functions
    2. part-r-00000 file -> txt file with keys and values, results of MapReduce
    3. shell file -> txt file with the shell commands used to visualize the intended result

There are the questions I had and the achieved results:

    1. Which country has made the most commercial transactions?
        Australia    307522
        
    2. Which goods has the most commercial transactions in Brasil?
